# EIP-Assignment-1

This notebook includes, 50 misclassified images from the pre-trained **ResNet18** Model trained on CIFAR10.

grad CAM is apllied on these misclassified images, and with this we get an opportunity why these images failed to classify correctly. Whether the reason is the poor image or the imperfect model. All these observations can be seen in the above notebook.

The above notebook, does not include model training, building, hyperparameter tuning code or explanation. I will focus on where model looks when we apply the model on the input image, using grad CAM.
